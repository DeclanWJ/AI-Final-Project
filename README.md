# AI-Final-Project
Repository for our final project in Artificial Intelligence

Meeting # 1 (3/21/2021)
Notes:
  Start with tree cutting, Q-learning agent. 
  Posisbly move to more advance task, like combat if possible. 
  Learn how to read/write to file so you can save weights/values of states (or do we?)
  Other forms of RL? 
  Possibility: Combing tasks to optimize getting gold or exp
  Show progress from:
    Basic AI
    Basic AI that performs tasks
    Basic AI with RL to improve certain tasks and optimize getting materias
    RL AI that can perform multiple tasks and optimize something general like getting gold or exp
    RL AI that can perform combat, optimizing living, defeating enemies, gaining exp
    (May not get a fully functional combat AI, but show progress and difficulties in report )

Progress:
  Watched videos to create our own general AI that can navigate the environment and perform basic tasks
  Created Final Report copy in open leaf, and started editing
